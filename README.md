**code_array1.rb**
>Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array and print them on screen.
**code_array1.rb**
Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Again ask user to give a number. Now, tell user whether that number is present in array or not.
( Iterate over array using while loop ).
**code_array1.rb**
Take 20 integer inputs from user and print the following:
number of positive numbers
number of negative numbers
number of odd numbers
number of even numbers
number of 0s.
**code_array1.rb**
Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Now, copy all the elements in another array but in reverse order.
**code_array1.rb**
Write a program to find the sum of all elements of an array.
**code_array1.rb**
Write a program to find the product of all elements of an array.
**code_array1.rb**
Initialize and print each element in new line of a array inside array.
**code_array1.rb**
Find the largest and smallest elements of an array.
**code_array1.rb**
Write a program to print sum, average of all numbers, smallest and largest element of an array.
**code_array1.rb**
Write a program to check if elements of a array are same or not it read from front or back. E.g.-
2	3	15	15	3	2
**code_array1.rb**
Make a array by taking 10 input from user. Now delete all repeated elements of the array.
E.g.-
INPUT : [1,2,3,2,1,3,12,12,32]
OUTPUT : [1,2,3,12,32]
**code_array1.rb**
Take an array of 10 elements. Split it into middle and store the elements in two dfferent arrays. E.g.-
INITIAL array :
58	24	13	15	63	9	8	81	1	78

After spliting :
58	24	13	15	63
9	8	81	1	78
**code_array1.rb**
Ask user to give integer inputs to make a array. Store only even values given and print the array.
